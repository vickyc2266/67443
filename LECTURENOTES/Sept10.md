Creating Great Mobile Apps

Key parts of DESIGN - interactions and tradeoffs 
    e.g.
        -Limitation of Mobile Device - screen size, no hover, connectivity importance 

What makes a great mobile app?/Understand the mobile mental model
    -easily transportable 
    -allows for "micro-tasking"
    -"I'm local" -> the phone knows where you are
    -"I'm bored" -> people go on their phones when they're bored, want to be distracted

Strengths of Mobile Device 
    1. Communication (via text, phone, ft, etc)
    2. Spontaneous (Things can be done right then and there)
    3. Goe-sensitive (Could track your location)
    4. Short periods of use (Performance with short term activity)
    5. Focused activity 
    6. Form-factor/size limitations 

Making Intuitive Apps 
    1. Important to increase learnability 

Blue Ocean Innovation 
    -winning by creating an uncontested market space and making the competition irrelevant (invention of the iphone, completely new)
    -Solving a Pain point (most vital and important)

Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean 
1. Compete in existing market space : created uncontested market space
2. Beat the competition : Make the competition irrelevant
3. Exploit existing demand : Create and capture new demand
4. Make the value-cost trade off : Break the value-cost trade off 

What is your app's life span?
    -who are we serving and how long could we possibly be serving them for 
    -how do we get returning users (some apps are one time using)
    -Notifications 
    -once we're in the market and sustainable, we could then incorporate other features

What is your Niche?
    -What's your target group?

Desirability - Feasibility - Viability Framework
    Desirability (Human, Design thinking)
    Viability (organization)
    Feasibility (Technology)
    Lastly: Innovation
