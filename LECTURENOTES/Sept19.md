Model UI Patterns

Navigation Bars
    -stack mindset

Tab Bars 
    -Used to organize info at the app level
    -A form of navigation; sometimes used with nav bar and sometime in place of it
    -Limit number of tabs (5 max, 4 is better)
    - Should highlight active tabs, but never disable a tab
    - Great icons help users more than just text
    -Getting rid of tab would lead to gulf of expectation issue 
    -always user test everything, including icons 

Search Bars
    -Search functionality often important navigation tool for users 
    -The search bar in iOS has easy recognition and can customize the start text
    -Should consider adding clear and/or cancel buttons 
    -Often best when tab;e results update with search input
    -Almost always on top

Toolbars
    -Great for adding commonly used functionality 
    -Can change if context is changed
    -Common tasks probably have common icons (preferred to text)
    -Don't overcrowd - provide adequate spacing 

Table Views 
    - Have intuitive designs
    - minimize distractions with designs 
    - app design for engagement and recognition

Collection Views 
    - Staying with standard grids is usually best
    - Size can vary within the collection view
    - Content needs to be easy to click on, so items can't be too small
    - Clustering when appropriate 

Image Views 
    -"Content us king" - image views capture that idea
    -Typically non-interactive but can be animated
    -Linking in with gestures 

Scroll Views and Web Views
    -Allows people to interact with large content 
    -Is connected with standard gestures
    -No appearance itself, but does display transient scrolling indicators as people interact with it
    -Use of web views so as not to reinvent the wheel

Alerts 
    -Used to communicate important information to the user
    -Typically tru to minimize use of alerts as they can de disruptive to workflow
    -Alerts with two buttons best

Action Sheets 
 -Use an action sheet to: 
 -LET PEOPLE INITIATE TASK, OR

Activity Views 
    - An activity is a task, such as Copy, Favorite, etc

Notifications 
    -Should never see an notification for an app when I'm in an app 
    -Notifications should only be used to get users into the app
    -The design of the app should be intuitive enough without notifications
