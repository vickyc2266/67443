Understanding Users Better
-Biggest challenge is not technical
-Understand your audience and their needs first
-First step is often to interview subjects
-How many interviews are enough?

Important Rules 
    1. Average isn't good enough
    2. Gather Evidence, Not Opinions 
        -Make your decisions based on evidence and facts
    3. First Hand Experience Only

Class Activity Question: Do you compare prices while shopping for household goods? If so, how do you compare?

    -She's listing a specific example of what the interviewee does and says she does exactly what she says
    -Used Target app at Target shopping but usually doesn't use a shopping app and just keeps a mental note

Biggest challenge this year is to build something that appeals to our users
After interviews, we ant to formalize the knowledge we've captured 

Sequence Modeling 
    -Represents the steps users fo through to accomplish a certain activity, including breakdowns 
    -Triggers: that start a sequence (one model may have many)
    -Intent that highlights the user's reason for completing a process
    -Breakdown: breakdowns the sequence for opportunities to improve 


Prototype 
    -Once you have an understanding of your audience, you need to encapsulate that learning with the wireframe
    also the key set up in helping us bride the 2 gulfs
        What I think I did and what I actually did (Guld of Expectation)
        What I want to do and what I actually can do (Gulf of Execution)

Start with Low fidality WireFrames first
    1. time saving, can explore lots of ideas at low cost
    2. Easy for visual interaction to overwhelm other interactions
    3. Honestly from users improves
        -Users will be willing to give you their honest feedback especially if its low fidality

3 key questions 

    D0 users know how to do ________?

    is it easy for the user to do _______?

    How can we make this better ________?

Next level of wire framing 
-create high fildality wireframes
-adding colors, images, etc
