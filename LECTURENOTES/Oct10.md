# The Lenses of Mobile Accessibility 

# Mobile Accessibility : 
    -the design and config of mobile devices 

# The Persona Spectrum

Disability: a contextual variable, dynamic over time and in relation tp circumstances
    -one is more or less disabled based on the interaction between the person and the individual, institutional and social environments 
    -everyone's differently abled

Important US Legislation: 
    ADA: General Disabilities
    Section 508: Federal 
        -set of rules and guidelines that makes any federally tied documents/resources accessible 
    Section 1557: Health
    ACAA: Air Carrier
    CVAA: Comm & Video
    IDEA: Education for all
    Section 504: School Children

25% of the 4,600 digital lawsuits filed in federal court in 2023 targeted a company that had been sued previously

Mobile Interactions & The Lenses of Accessibility 
    -Those that enable interaction
    -visual representations 
        -words - lenses of typography and readability 

# Lens of Typography and Readability
    Which fonts should we choose?
        -e.g. San Serif, Serif 
    Always be conscious of hierarchy and type scale
        -Maintain a good hierarchy
        -Provide constant through size in mobile

    Mobile Typography 
        -A clear spatial hierarchy, smooth flow along lines, and adequate contrast
        -Spatial hierarchy 
            -the space between letters is less than the space between words
            -the space between words is less than the space between lines
        -Justified text in general not recommended 
        Ragged right text apparently helps resume reading if distracted
    
    Lense of Color 
        -to draw attention
            -warning signs use bright colors 
        -to make the display more attractive
            -aesthetics is as important as usability 
        -to show state
            -navigate elements
        -For organizing the display content
            -differentiate groups of elements or to show perspective
        -Color should not be used as a the sole means of communication
    
    The Importance of Contrast

# Lens of Structure 
    -InformationArchitecture: is your document organizes such that everyone can navigate it easily?
        - 3 components to the answer: Information organization, labels and icons, navigation system
        - Why IA important from an accessibility perspective 
            => people with certain mental models, dyslexia, screen reader with a lot of content (so we need to turn towards the     index with a lot of the information)
    
    Tips for Designing Labeling Systems 
        -Be consistent
            -Use of style, syntax, scale of register, presentation, granularity 
        -use your users' language
        
    Navigation Structures 
        -nested doll pattern 
    

# Lens of Control 
    -Touch interaction 
        -content is the UI
        -Enables direct manipulation of object and content
    
    Optimal Target size and figure size 

    Designing for Voice Interaction
        -user task flows and User Stories to be rethought 
        -Commands have to be rethought for not just information scent
        -No visual Affordances 
        -The interface should be considered personified 
        The importance of context
        -Limit the amount of info
    
# Guidelines ofr Images
    -Provide alternative descriptionof images 
        -screen readers read out this description
        -search engines also use this context
    -SVG: scalable vector graphics (algebraic expressions)

    Affordance
        -used for navigations
    
    Visual Hierarchies 
    Add space can sometimes be good
    animations (try to limit as much as possible: not good for people with cognitive problems)

    Avoid using autoplay and let user decide when to run

# Mobile and AI
    -Technological Limitations (size, touch, voice, contrast, audio quality)
    -Awareness and Training: Need for widespread training 
    -Cost factorsL investigation accessibility can reduce legal risks ad broaden market reach




# Class Notes
-Don't start with a class, start with a protocol
