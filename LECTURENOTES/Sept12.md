How to Build a Great Game
    Through Research
        -User Research (what they want)
        -Good User Experience (research on usability and UI)
        -How to build a good tutorial?
        -How to increase ratings and reviews
        -What are good color schemes
    
    Through User 
        -What is the perfect length for their tutorials
        -What step in the user experience results in the most ratings?
        -What button color results in the most clicks?

How to measure user bahavior?
    1. Find analytical tools (e.g. mixpanel)
    2. Determine "core metrics"
        EX:
            -board started/completed
            -time completed board
            -boards completed per session 
    3. Implement Code
    4. Observe Data
    5. Make decisions

What are users doing when they start tutorial?
    -Have a metric system set up that keeps track of what users are commonly doing in the tutorials  
    EX: the most common metric in the game's tutorial is users touching at random white space 
        -75% tutorial conversion rate
        -66.82% invalid touch somewhere during the tutorial 
        -23.89% first touch in tutorial is invalid 
            (this tells us maybe we should make the tutorial easier to understand)

A/B Test (testing a new feature)
    -Break all users into 2 groups (control and treatment group)
        -control group doesn't get the update vs treatment group gets the new feature
        -as many treatment groups you'll like to have or need


    Power User Funnel 
        1. All iphone users 
        2. App Store Impression 
        3. App Store Product Page View
        4. Download App
        5. Open App
        6. Start Tutorial
        7. Complete Tutorial 
        8. Compete 1 Level  
            -the first can never too easy
                -from the developer's perspective, everything is really easy and easy to use
        9. Complete 10 Levels 
        10.Complete 100 Levels 

Monetizing Your Game 
    1. Download Conversion
    2. Onboarding Conversion 
    3. Power User Conversion

    1. Advertize (users don't mind too much but not too often and  not full screen)
    2. Pay to Download (people won't want to download and pay for app)
    3. In-App Purchases (it's ok as long as done correctly and users don't need to rely on them to actually use app)
    4. Freemium/Subscription(partially free or free for now): this will affect user conversion

What is the Object of the Application 
    -Money 
    -Get More Users (this will lead to more data and can help you perfect the application)
